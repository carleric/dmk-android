things to include in dmk 1.0:

- status warning if packet capture rate drops below some threshold, warning user that 
the connectoin was lost.

- simple digital views of sensors (not fancy svg analog)

- put in 1st time run disclaimer, this is for recreational purposes only

- diagnostic mode, show packet stream, ability to freeze.

- stream view, inserts new packets at top. let those that move out of view at the bottom be destroyed,
or explicitly limit them through a config.  

things to do in dmklogger 1.0

- design backend to support multiple sensor instances. e.g. support multiple engines.

- LoggerController 
	- sets up UI
	- executes in main thread
	- creates and starts LoggerService
	
- LoggerService
	- creates wifi connection to DMK box
	- listens to port 1703 for packets
	- sends messages back to LoggerController in main UI thread
